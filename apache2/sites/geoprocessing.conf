    # The ProxyPass directive specifies the mapping of incoming requests to the backend server (or a cluster of servers known as a Balancer group).
    # It proxies the requests only with matching URI “/blog”
    ProxyPass /geoserver http://geoserver:8080/geoserver

    #To ensure that and Location: headers generated from the backend are modified to point to the reverse proxy, instead of back to itself, #the ProxyPassReverse directive is most often required:
    ProxyPassReverse /geoserver http://geoserver:8080/geoserver
